Overview<a class=anchor href=#overview></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>A project model is a means to reduce the communications overhead in a project.
As shown by [<a href=../dev-model/#brooks>Brooks</a>], increasing the number of project participants increases the communication in the project exponentionally.
FreeBSD has during the past few years increased both its mass of active users and committers, and the communication in the project has risen accordingly.
This project model will serve to reduce this overhead by providing an up-to-date description of the project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>During the Core elections in 2002, Mark Murray stated "I am opposed to a long rule-book, as that satisfies lawyer-tendencies, and is counter to the technocentricity that the project so badly needs."
[<a href=../dev-model/#bsd-election2002>FreeBSD</a>].
This project model is not meant to be a tool to justify creating impositions for developers, but as a tool to facilitate coordination.
It is meant as a description of the project, with an overview of how the different processes are executed.
It is an introduction to how the FreeBSD project works.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The FreeBSD project model will be described as of July 1st, 2004.
It is based on the Niels Jørgensen’s paper [<a href=../dev-model/#jorgensen2001>Jørgensen</a>], FreeBSD’s official documents, discussions on FreeBSD mailing lists and interviews with developers.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>After providing definitions of terms used, this document will outline the organisational structure (including role descriptions and communication lines), discuss the methodology model and after presenting the tools used for process control, it will present the defined processes.
Finally it will outline major sub-projects of the FreeBSD project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>[<a href=../dev-model/#freebsd-developer-handbook>FreeBSD</a>] Section 1.2 and 1.3 give the vision and the architectural guidelines for the project.
The vision is "To produce the best UNIX-like operating system package possible, with due respect to the original software tools ideology as well as usability, performance and stability."
The architectural guidelines help determine whether a problem that someone wants to be solved is within the scope of the project</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=definitions>2.

Activity<a class=anchor href=#ref-activity></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>An "activity" is an element of work performed during the course of a project
[<a href=../dev-model/#ref-pmbok>PMI</a>].
It has an output and leads towards an outcome.
Such an output can either be an input to another activity or a part of the process' delivery.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=def-process>2.2. Process<a class=anchor href=#def-process></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>A "process" is a series of activities that lead towards a particular outcome.
A process can consist of one or more sub-processes.
An example of a process is software design.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=ref-hat>2.3. Hat<a class=anchor href=#ref-hat></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>A "hat" is synonymous with role.
A hat has certain responsibilities in a process and for the process outcome.
The hat executes activities.
It is well defined what issues the hat should be contacted about by the project members and people outside the project.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=ref-outcome>2.4. Outcome<a class=anchor href=#ref-outcome></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>An "outcome" is the final output of the process.
This is synonymous with deliverable, that is defined as "any measurable, tangible, verifiable outcome, result or item that must be produced to complete a project or part of a project.
Often used more narrowly in reference to an external deliverable, which is a
deliverable that is subject to approval by the project sponsor or customer" by
[<a href=../dev-model/#ref-pmbok>PMI</a>].
Examples of outcomes are a piece of software, a decision made or a report written.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=ref-freebsd>2.5.

It is with their contributions that the project can move forward.
Regular developers are referred to as contributors.
As of January 1st, 2003, there are an estimated 5500 contributors on the project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Committers are developers with the privilege of being able to commit changes.
These are usually the most active developers who are willing to spend their time not only integrating their own code but integrating code submitted by the developers who do not have this privilege.
They are also the developers who elect the core team, and they have access to closed discussions.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The project can be grouped into four distinct separate parts, and most developers will focus their involvement in one part of FreeBSD.
The four parts are kernel development, userland development, ports and documentation.
When referring to the base system, both kernel and userland is meant.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>This split changes our table to look like this:</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The FreeBSD Project’s structure with committers in categories</p></div><table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch informaltable"><col style=width:33.3333%><col style=width:33.3333%><col style=width:33.3334%><thead><tr><th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Group</th><th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Category</th><th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Number of people</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Core members</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>9</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Committers</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Base</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>164</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Docs</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>45</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Ports</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>166</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Total</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>374</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>Contributors</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class=tableblock>~3000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=paragraph><p>Number of committers per area has been determined by going through CVS logs from January 1st, 2004 to December 31st, 2004.
Note that many committers work in multiple areas, making the total number higher than the real number of committers.
The total number of active unique committers on June 2022 was 317.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Committers fall into three groups: committers who are only concerned with one area of the project (for instance file systems), committers who are involved only with one sub-project, and committers who commit to different parts of the code, including sub-projects.
Because some committers work on different parts, the total number in the committers section of the table is higher than in the above table.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The kernel is the main building block of FreeBSD.
While the userland applications are protected against faults in other userland applications, the entire system is vulnerable to errors in the kernel.
This, combined with the vast amount of dependencies in the kernel and that it is not easy to see all the consequences of a kernel change, demands developers with a relative full understanding of the kernel.
Multiple development efforts in the kernel also require a closer coordination than userland applications do.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The core utilities, known as userland, provide the interface that identifies FreeBSD, both user interface, shared libraries and external interfaces to connecting clients.
Currently, 162 people are involved in userland development and maintenance, many being maintainers for their own part of the code.
Maintainership will be discussed in the <a href=../dev-model/#role-maintainer>Maintainership</a> section.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Documentation is handled by <a href=../dev-model/#sub-project-documentation>The FreeBSD Documentation Project</a> and includes all documents surrounding the FreeBSD project, including the web pages.
There were during 2004 101 people making commits to the FreeBSD Documentation Project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Ports is the collection of meta-data that is needed to make software packages build correctly on FreeBSD.
An example of a port is the port for the web-browser Mozilla.
It contains information about where to fetch the source, what patches to apply and how, and how the package should be installed on the system.
This allows automated tools to fetch, build and install the package.
As of this writing, there are more than 12600 ports available.
<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_2 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_2 title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> , ranging from web servers to games, programming languages and most of the application types that are in use on modern computers.

Unless each stage is finished successfully, the developer needs to go back and make modifications in the code and restart the process.
To integrate a change with either -CURRENT or -STABLE is called making a commit.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Jørgensen found that most FreeBSD developers work individually, meaning that this model is used in parallel by many developers on the different ongoing development efforts.
A developer can also be working on multiple changes, so that while they are waiting for review or people to test one or more of their changes, they may be writing another change.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>As each commit represents an increment, this is a massively incremental model.
The commits are in fact so frequent that during one year <sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_3 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_3 title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> , 85427 commits were made, making a daily average of 233 commits.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Within the "code" bracket in Jørgensen’s model, each programmer has their own working style and follows their own development models.
The bracket could very well have been called "development" as it includes requirements gathering and analysis, system and detailed design, implementation and verification.
However, the only output from these stages is the source code or system documentation.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>From a stepwise model’s perspective (such as the waterfall model), the other brackets can be seen as further verification and system integration.
This system integration is also important to see if a change is accepted by the community.
Up until the code is committed, the developer is free to choose how much to communicate about it to the rest of the project.
In order for -CURRENT to work as a buffer (so that bright ideas that had some undiscovered drawbacks can be backed out) the minimum time a commit should be in -CURRENT before merging it to -STABLE is 3 days.
Such a merge is referred to as an MFC (Merge From Current).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>It is important to notice the word "change".
Most commits do not contain radical new features, but are maintenance updates.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The only exceptions from this model are security fixes and changes to features that are deprecated in the -CURRENT branch.
In these cases, changes can be committed directly to the -STABLE branch.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>In addition to many people working on the project, there are many related projects to the FreeBSD Project.
These are either projects developing brand new features, sub-projects or projects whose outcome is incorporated into FreeBSD <sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_4 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_4 title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>.
These projects fit into the FreeBSD Project just like regular development efforts: they produce code that is integrated with the FreeBSD Project.
However, some of them (like Ports and Documentation) have the privilege of being applicable to both branches or commit directly to both -CURRENT and -STABLE.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>There is no standards to how design should be done, nor is design collected in a centralised repository.
The main design is that of 4.4BSD.
<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_5 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_5 title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>
As design is a part of the "Code" bracket in Jørgenssen’s model, it is up to every developer or sub-project how this should be done.
Even if the design should be stored in a central repository, the output from the design stages would be of limited use as the differences of methodologies would make them poorly if at all interoperable.
For the overall design of the project, the project relies on the sub-projects to negotiate fit interfaces between each other rather than to dictate interfacing.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=release-branches>4.2. Release branches<a class=anchor href=#release-branches></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The releases of FreeBSD are best illustrated by a tree with many branches where each major branch represents a major version.

Boxes with full lines and diamonds represent official releases.
Boxes with dotted lines represent the development branch at that time.
Security branches are represented by ovals.
Diamonds differ from boxes in that they represent a fork, meaning a place where a branch splits into two branches where one of the branches becomes a sub-branch.
For example, at 4.0-RELEASE the 4.0-CURRENT branch split into 4-STABLE and 5.0-CURRENT. At 4.5-RELEASE, the branch forked off a security branch called RELENG_4_5.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=../../../images/books/dev-model/branches.png alt="Refer to table below for a screen-reader friendly version."></div><div class=title>Figure 1.

However, the -CURRENT branch does not need to fork at that point in time, but can focus on stabilising.
An example of this is that following 3.0-RELEASE, 3.1-RELEASE was also a continuation of the -CURRENT-branch, and -CURRENT did not become a true development branch until this version was released and the 3-STABLE branch was forked.
When -CURRENT returns to becoming a development branch, it can only be followed by a major release.
5-STABLE is predicted to be forked off 5.0-CURRENT at around 5.3-RELEASE.
It is not until 5-STABLE is forked that the development branch will be branded 6.0-CURRENT.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A "minor release" is made from the -CURRENT branch following a major release, or from the -STABLE branch.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Following and including, 4.3-RELEASE<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_6 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_6 title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup>, when a minor release has been made, it becomes a "security branch".
This is meant for organisations that do not want to follow the -STABLE branch and the potential new/changed features it offers, but instead require an absolutely stable environment, only updating to implement security updates. <sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_7 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_7 title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup></p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Each update to a security branch is called a "patchlevel".
For every security enhancement that is done, the patchlevel number is increased, making it easy for people tracking the branch to see what security enhancements they have implemented.
In cases where there have been especially serious security flaws, an entire new release can be made from a security branch.
An example of this is 4.6.2-RELEASE.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=model-summary>4.3.

These roles are called hats.
These hats can be either project roles, such as public relations officer, or maintainer for a certain area of the code.

They must therefore appoint a deputy that can perform the hat’s role in their absence.

Formalised hats have a charter stating the exact purpose of the hat along with its privileges and responsibilities.

In this case, it can also be restored at a later time by core, should the committer ask.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Roles in this process:</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><p><a href=../dev-model/#role-core>Core Team</a></p></li><li><p><a href=../dev-model/#role-contributor>Contributor</a></p></li><li><p><a href=../dev-model/#role-committer>Committer</a></p></li><li><p><a href=../dev-model/#role-maintainer>Maintainership</a></p></li><li><p><a href=../dev-model/#role-mentor>Mentor</a></p></li></ol></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=committing>Committing code<a class=anchor href=#committing></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The committing of new or modified code is one of the most frequent processes in the FreeBSD project and will usually happen many times a day.
Committing of code can only be done by a "committer".
Committers commit either code written by themselves, code submitted to them, or
code submitted through a <a href=../dev-model/#model-pr>problem report</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When code is written by the developer that is non-trivial, they should seek a code review from the community.
This is done by sending mail to the relevant list asking for review.
Before submitting the code for review, they should ensure it compiles correctly with the entire tree and that all relevant tests run.
This is called "pre-commit test".
When contributed code is received, it should be reviewed by the committer and tested the same way.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When a change is committed to a part of the source that has been contributed
from an outside <a href=../dev-model/#role-vendor>Vendor</a>, the maintainer should ensure that the patch is contributed back to the vendor.
This is in line with the open source philosophy and makes it easier to stay in sync with outside projects as the patches do not have to be reapplied every time a new release is made.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>After the code has been available for review and no further changes are necessary, the code is committed into the development branch, -CURRENT.
If the change applies for the -STABLE branch or the other branches as well, a "Merge From Current" ("MFC") countdown is set by the committer.
After the number of days the committer chose when setting the MFC have passed, an email will automatically be sent to the committer reminding them to commit it to the -STABLE branch (and possibly security branches as well).
Only security critical changes should be merged to security branches.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Delaying the commit to -STABLE and other branches allows for "parallel debugging" where the committed code is tested on a wide range of configurations.
This makes changes to -STABLE to contain fewer faults and thus giving the branch its name.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=../../../images/books/dev-model/proc-commit.png alt="Refer to paragraph below for a screen-reader friendly version."></div><div class=title>Figure 5. Process summary: A committer commits code</div></div><div class=paragraph><p>When a committer has written a piece of code and wants to commit it, they first need to determine if it is trivial enough to go in without prior review or if it should first be reviewed by the developer community.
If the code is trivial or has been reviewed and the committer is not the maintainer, they should consult the maintainer before proceeding.
If the code is contributed by an outside vendor, the maintainer should create a patch that is sent back to the vendor.
The code is then committed and then deployed by the users.
Should they find problems with the code, this will be reported and the committer can go back to writing a patch.
If a vendor is affected, they can choose to implement or ignore the patch.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=../../../images/books/dev-model/proc-contrib.png alt="Refer to paragraphs below and above for a screen-reader friendly version."></div><div class=title>Figure 6.

These projects are generally done by one person
[<a href=../dev-model/#jorgensen2001>Jørgensen</a>].
Every project is free to organise development as it sees fit.
However, when the project is merged to the -CURRENT branch it must follow the project guidelines.
When the code has been well tested in the -CURRENT branch and deemed stable enough and relevant to the -STABLE branch, it is merged to the -STABLE branch.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The requirements of the project are given by developer wishes, requests from the community in terms of direct requests by mail, Problem Reports, commercial funding for the development of features, or contributions by the scientific community.
The wishes that come within the responsibility of a developer are given to that developer who prioritises their time between the request and their wishes.
A common way to do this is maintain a TODO-list maintained by the project.
Items that do not come within someone’s responsibility are collected on TODO-lists unless someone volunteers to take the responsibility.
All requests, their distribution and follow-up are handled by the
<a href=../dev-model/#tool-bugzilla>Bugzilla</a> tool.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Requirements analysis happens in two ways.
The requests that come in are discussed on mailing lists, both within the main project and in the sub-project that the request belongs to or is spawned by the request.
Furthermore, individual developers on the sub-project will evaluate the feasibility of the requests and determine the prioritisation between them.
Other than archives of the discussions that have taken place, no outcome is created by this phase that is merged into the main project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>As the requests are prioritised by the individual developers on the basis of doing what they find interesting, necessary, or are funded to do, there is no overall strategy or prioritisation of what requests to regard as requirements and following up their correct implementation.
However, most developers have some shared vision of what issues are more important, and they can ask for guidelines from the release engineering team.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The verification phase of the project is two-fold.
Before committing code to the current-branch, developers request their code to be reviewed by their peers.
This review is for the most part done by functional testing, but also code review is important.
When the code is committed to the branch, a broader functional testing will happen, that may trigger further code review and debugging should the code not behave as expected.
This second verification form may be regarded as structural verification.
Although the sub-projects themselves may write formal tests such as unit tests, these are usually not collected by the main project and are usually removed before the code is committed to the current branch. <sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_9 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_9 title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=model-maintenance>6.2. Maintenance<a class=anchor href=#model-maintenance></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>It is an advantage to the project to for each area of the source have at least one person that knows this area well.
Some parts of the code have designated maintainers. Others have de-facto maintainers, and some parts of the system do not have maintainers.
The maintainer is usually a person from the sub-project that wrote and integrated the code, or someone who has ported it from the platform it was written for.
<sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_10 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_10 title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>
The maintainer’s job is to make sure the code is in sync with the project the code comes from if it is contributed code, and apply patches submitted by the community or write fixes to issues that are discovered.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The main bulk of work that is put into the FreeBSD project is maintenance.

When they commit a change to a branch, that constitutes a new release.
It is very common for users in the community to track a particular branch.
The immediate existence of a new release makes the changes widely available right away and allows for rapid feedback from the community.
This also gives the community the response time they expect on issues that are of importance to them.
This makes the community more engaged, and thus allows for more and better feedback that again spurs more maintenance and ultimately should create a better product.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Before making changes to code in parts of the tree that has a history unknown to the committer, the committer is required to read the commit logs to see why certain features are implemented the way they are in order not to make mistakes that have previously either been thought through or resolved.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=model-pr>6.3. Problem reporting<a class=anchor href=#model-pr></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>Before FreeBSD 10, FreeBSD included a problem reporting tool called <code>send-pr</code>.
Problems include bug reports, feature requests, feature enhancements and notices of new versions of external software that are included in the project.
Although <code>send-pr</code> is available, users and developers are encouraged to submit issues using our <a href=https://bugs.freebsd.org/submit/>problem report form</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Problem reports are sent to an email address where it is inserted into the Problem Reports maintenance database.
A <a href=../dev-model/#role-bugbuster>Bugbuster</a> classifies the problem and sends it to the correct group or maintainer within the project.
After someone has taken responsibility for the report, the report is being analysed.
This analysis includes verifying the problem and thinking out a solution for the problem.
Often feedback is required from the report originator or even from the FreeBSD community.
Once a patch for the problem is made, the originator may be asked to try it out.
Finally, the working patch is integrated into the project, and documented if applicable.
It there goes through the regular maintenance cycle as described in section
<a href=../dev-model/#model-maintenance>Maintenance</a>.
These are the states a problem report can be in: open, analyzed, feedback, patched, suspended and closed.
The suspended state is for when further progress is not possible due to the lack of information or for when the task would require so much work that nobody is working on it at the moment.</p></div><div class=imageblock><div class=content><img src=../../../images/books/dev-model/proc-pr.png alt="Refer to paragraph below for a screen-reader friendly version."></div><div class=title>Figure 8.

Release engineering<a class=anchor href=#process-release-engineering></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The FreeBSD project has a Release Engineering team with a principal release engineer that is responsible for creating releases of FreeBSD that can be brought out to the user community via the net or sold in retail outlets.
Since FreeBSD is available on multiple platforms and releases for the different architectures are made available at the same time, the team has one person in charge of each architecture.
Also, there are roles in the team responsible for coordinating quality assurance efforts, building a package set and for having an updated set of documents.
When referring to the release engineer, a representative for the release engineering team is meant.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When a release is coming, the FreeBSD project changes shape somewhat.
A release schedule is made containing feature- and code-freezes, release of interim releases and the final release.
A feature-freeze means no new features are allowed to be committed to the branch without the release engineers' explicit consent.
Code-freeze means no changes to the code (like bugs-fixes) are allowed to be committed without the release engineers' explicit consent.
This feature- and code-freeze is known as stabilising.
During the release process, the release engineer has the full authority to revert to older versions of code and thus "back out" changes should they find that the changes are not suitable to be included in the release.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>There are three different kinds of releases:</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><p>.0 releases are the first release of a major version. These are branched of the -CURRENT branch and have a significantly longer release engineering cycle due to the unstable nature of the -CURRENT branch</p></li><li><p>.X releases are releases of the -STABLE branch. They are scheduled to come out every 4 months.</p></li><li><p>.X.Y releases are security releases that follow the .X branch. These come out only when sufficient security fixes have been merged since the last release on that branch. New features are rarely included, and the security team is far more involved in these than in regular releases.</p></li></ol></div><div class=paragraph><p>For releases of the -STABLE-branch, the release process starts 45 days before the anticipated release date.
During the first phase, the first 15 days, the developers merge what changes they have had in -CURRENT that they want to have in the release to the release branch.
When this period is over, the code enters a 15 day code freeze in which only bug fixes, documentation updates, security-related fixes and minor device driver changes are allowed.
These changes must be approved by the release engineer in advance. At the beginning of the last 15 day period a release candidate is created for widespread testing.
Updates are less likely to be allowed during this period, except for important bug fixes and security updates.
In this final period, all releases are considered release candidates.
At the end of the release process, a release is created with the new version number, including binary distributions on web sites and the creation of CD-ROM images.
However, the release is not considered "really released" until a
<a href=../dev-model/#tool-pgp>Pretty Good Privacy</a>-signed message stating exactly that, is sent to the mailing list freebsd-announce; anything labelled as a "release" before that may well be in-process and subject to change before the PGP-signed message is sent. <sup class=footnote>[<a id=_footnoteref_11 class=footnote href=#_footnotedef_11 title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The releases of the -CURRENT-branch (that is, all releases that end with ".0") are very similar, but with twice as long timeframe.
It starts 8 weeks prior to the release with announcement of the release time line.
Two weeks into the release process, the feature freeze is initiated and performance tweaks should be kept to a minimum.
Four weeks prior to the release, an official beta version is made available.
Two weeks prior to release, the code is officially branched into a new version.
This version is given release candidate status, and as with the release engineering of -STABLE, the code freeze of the release candidate is hardened.
However, development on the main development branch can continue.
Other than these differences, the release engineering processes are alike.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>*.0 releases go into their own branch and are aimed mainly at early adopters.
The branch then goes through a period of stabilisation, and it is not until the
<a href=../dev-model/#role-releng>Release Engineering Team</a> decides the demands to stability have been satisfied that the branch becomes -STABLE and -CURRENT targets the next major version. While this for the majority has been with *.1 versions, this is not a demand.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Most releases are made when a given date that has been deemed a long enough time since the previous release comes.
A target is set for having major releases every 18 months and minor releases every 4 months.
The user community has made it very clear that security and stability cannot be sacrificed by self-imposed deadlines and target release dates.
For slips of time not to become too long with regards to security and stability issues, extra discipline is required when committing changes to -STABLE.</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><p>Make release schedule</p></li><li><p>Feature freeze</p></li><li><p>Code freeze</p></li><li><p>Make branch</p></li><li><p>Release candidate</p></li><li><p>Stabilize release (loop back to previous step as many times as necessary; when release is considered stable, proceed with next step)</p></li><li><p>Build packages</p></li><li><p>Warn mirrors</p></li><li><p>Publish release</p></li></ol></div><div class=paragraph><p>[ <a href=../dev-model/#freebsd-releng>FreeBSD</a> ]</p></div></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=tools>7.

General lists are lists for the general public, technical lists are mainly for the development of specific areas of interest, and closed lists are for internal communication not intended for the general public.

The FreeBSD Documentation Project<a class=anchor href=#sub-project-documentation></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The FreeBSD Documentation project was started January 1995.
From the initial group of a project leader, four team leaders and 16 members, they are now a total of 44 committers.
The documentation mailing list has just under 300 members, indicating that there is quite a large community around it.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The goal of the Documentation project is to provide good and useful documentation of the FreeBSD project, thus making it easier for new users to get familiar with the system and detailing advanced features for the users.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The main tasks in the Documentation project are to work on current projects in the "FreeBSD Documentation Set", and translate the documentation to other languages.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Like the FreeBSD Project, documentation is split in the same branches.
This is done so that there is always an updated version of the documentation for each version.
Only documentation errors are corrected in the security branches.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Like the ports sub-project, the Documentation project can appoint documentation
committers without FreeBSD Core’s approval.
[<a href=../dev-model/#freebsd-doceng-charter>FreeBSD</a>].</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The Documentation project has <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/fdp-primer/>a primer</a>.
This is used both to introduce new project members to the standard tools and syntaxes and to act as a reference when working on the project.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=bibliography>References<a class=anchor href=#bibliography></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div id=brooks class=paragraph><p>[Brooks, 1995] Frederick P.

For instance, the development of the Bluetooth stack started as a sub-project until it was deemed stable enough to be merged into the -CURRENT branch. Now it is a part of the core FreeBSD system.</div><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_5><a href=#_footnoteref_5>5</a>. According to Kirk McKusick, after 20 years of developing UNIX operating systems, the interfaces are for the most part figured out. There is therefore no need for much design. However, new applications of the system and new hardware leads to some implementations being more beneficial than those that used to be preferred. One example is the introduction of web browsing that made the normal TCP/IP connection a short burst of data rather than a steady stream over a longer period of time.</div><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_6><a href=#_footnoteref_6>6</a>. The first release this actually happened for was 4.5-RELEASE, but security branches were at the same time created for 4.3-RELEASE and 4.4-RELEASE.</div><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_7><a href=#_footnoteref_7>7</a>. There is a terminology overlap with respect to the word "stable", which leads to some confusion. The -STABLE branch is still a development branch, whose goal is to be useful for most people. If it is never acceptable for a system to get changes that are not announced at the time it is deployed, that system should run a security branch.</div><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_8><a href=#_footnoteref_8>8</a>. The first Core election was held September 2000</div><div class=footnote id=_footnotedef_9><a href=#_footnoteref_9>9</a>.
