The device that connects the two networks in this way is called a bridge.
A FreeBSD system with two network interfaces is enough to act as a bridge.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A bridge works by scanning the addresses of MAC level (Ethernet addresses) of the devices connected to each of its network interfaces and then forwarding the traffic between the two networks only if the source and the destination are on different segments.
Under many points of view a bridge is similar to an Ethernet switch with only two ports.</p></div><hr></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-why>1. Why use a filtering bridge?<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-why></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>More and more frequently, thanks to the lowering costs of broad band Internet connections (xDSL) and also because of the reduction of available IPv4 addresses, many companies are connected to the Internet 24 hours on 24 and with few (sometimes not even a power of 2) IP addresses.
In these situations it is often desirable to have a firewall that filters incoming and outgoing traffic from and towards Internet, but a packet filtering solution based on router may not be applicable, either due to subnetting issues, the router is owned by the connectivity supplier (ISP), or because it does not support such functionalities.
In these scenarios the use of a filtering bridge is highly advised.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A bridge-based firewall can be configured and inserted between the xDSL router and your Ethernet hub/switch without any IP numbering issues.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-how>2. How to Install<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-how></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Adding bridge functionalities to a FreeBSD system is not difficult.
Since 4.5 release it is possible to load such functionalities as modules instead of having to rebuild the kernel, simplifying the procedure a great deal.
In the following subsections I will explain both installation ways.</p></div><div class="admonitionblock important"><table><tbody><tr><td class=icon><i class="fa icon-important" title=Important></i></td><td class=content><div class=paragraph><p><em>Do not</em> follow both instructions: a procedure <em>excludes</em> the other one.
Select the best choice according to your needs and abilities.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=paragraph><p>Before going on, be sure to have at least two Ethernet cards that support the promiscuous mode for both reception and transmission, since they must be able to send Ethernet packets with any address, not just their own.
Moreover, to have a good throughput, the cards should be PCI bus mastering cards.
The best choices are still the Intel EtherExpress™ Pro, followed by the 3Com® 3c9xx series.
To simplify the firewall configuration it may be useful to have two cards of different manufacturers (using different drivers) to distinguish clearly which interface is connected to the router and which to the inner network.</p></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=filtering-bridges-kernel>2.1. Kernel Configuration<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-kernel></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>So you have decided to use the older but well tested installation method.
To begin, you have to add the following rows to your kernel configuration file:</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre>options BRIDGE
options IPFIREWALL
options IPFIREWALL_VERBOSE</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>The first line is to compile the bridge support, the second one is the firewall and the third one is the logging functions of the firewall.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Now it is necessary to build and install the new kernel.
You may find detailed instructions in the <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/#kernelconfig-building>Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</a> section of the FreeBSD Handbook.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=filtering-bridges-modules>2.2. Modules Loading<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-modules></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>If you have chosen to use the new and simpler installation method, the only thing to do now is add the following row to <span class=filename>/boot/loader.conf</span>:</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre>bridge_load=&#34;YES&#34;</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>In this way, during the system startup, the <span class=filename>bridge.ko</span> module will be loaded together with the kernel.
It is not required to add a similar row for the <span class=filename>ipfw.ko</span> module, since it will be loaded automatically after the execution of the steps in the following section.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-finalprep>3. Final Preparation<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-finalprep></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Before rebooting to load the new kernel or the required modules (according to the previously chosen installation method), you have to make some changes to the <span class=filename>/etc/rc.conf</span> configuration file.
The default rule of the firewall is to reject all IP packets.
Initially we will set up an <code>open</code> firewall, to verify its operation without any issue related to packet filtering (in case you are going to execute this procedure remotely, such configuration will avoid you to remain isolated from the network).
Put these lines in <span class=filename>/etc/rc.conf</span>:</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre>firewall_enable=&#34;YES&#34;
firewall_type=&#34;open&#34;
firewall_quiet=&#34;YES&#34;
firewall_logging=&#34;YES&#34;</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>The first row will enable the firewall (and will load the module <span class=filename>ipfw.ko</span> if it is not compiled in the kernel), the second one to set up it in <code>open</code> mode (as explained in <span class=filename>/etc/rc.firewall</span>), the third one to not show rules loading and the fourth one to enable logging support.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>About the configuration of the network interfaces, the most used way is to assign an IP to only one of the network cards, but the bridge will work equally even if both interfaces or none has a configured IP.
In the last case (IP-less) the bridge machine will be still more hidden, as inaccessible from the network: to configure it, you have to login from console or through a third network interface separated from the bridge.
Sometimes, during the system startup, some programs require network access, say for domain resolution: in this case it is necessary to assign an IP to the external interface (the one connected to Internet, where DNS server resides), since the bridge will be activated at the end of the startup procedure.
It means that the <span class=filename>fxp0</span> interface (in our case) must be mentioned in the ifconfig section of the <span class=filename>/etc/rc.conf</span> file, while the <span class=filename>xl0</span> is not.
Assigning an IP to both the network cards does not make much sense, unless, during the start procedure, applications should access to services on both Ethernet segments.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>There is another important thing to know.
When running IP over Ethernet, there are actually two Ethernet protocols in use: one is IP, the other is ARP.
ARP does the conversion of the IP address of a host into its Ethernet address (MAC layer).
To allow the communication between two hosts separated by the bridge, it is necessary that the bridge will forward ARP packets.
Such protocol is not included in the IP layer, since it exists only with IP over Ethernet.
The FreeBSD firewall filters exclusively on the IP layer and therefore all non-IP packets (ARP included) will be forwarded without being filtered, even if the firewall is configured to not permit anything.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Now it is time to reboot the system and use it as before: there will be some new messages about the bridge and the firewall, but the bridge will not be activated and the firewall, being in <code>open</code> mode, will not avoid any operations.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If there are any problems, you should sort them out now before proceeding.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-enabling>4. Enabling the Bridge<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-enabling></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>At this point, to enable the bridge, you have to execute the following commands (having the shrewdness to replace the names of the two network interfaces <span class=filename>fxp0</span> and <span class=filename>xl0</span> with your own ones):</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang=shell><span class=c># sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.config=fxp0:0,xl0:0</span>
<span class=c># sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.ipfw=1</span>
<span class=c># sysctl net.link.ether.bridge.enable=1</span></code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>The first row specifies which interfaces should be activated by the bridge, the second one will enable the firewall on the bridge and finally the third one will enable the bridge.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>At this point you should be able to insert the machine between two sets of hosts without compromising any communication abilities between them.
If so, the next step is to add the <code>net.link.ether.bridge.<em>[blah]</em>=<em>[blah]</em></code> portions of these rows to the <span class=filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</span> file, to have them execute at startup.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-ipfirewall>5. Configuring The Firewall<a class=anchor href=#filtering-bridges-ipfirewall></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Now it is time to create your own file with custom firewall rules, to secure the inside network.
There will be some complication in doing this because not all of the firewall functionalities are available on bridged packets.
Furthermore, there is a difference between the packets that are in the process of being forwarded and packets that are being received by the local machine.
In general, incoming packets are run through the firewall only once, not twice as is normally the case; in fact they are filtered only upon receipt, so rules that use <code>out</code> or <code>xmit</code> will never match.
Personally, I use <code>in via</code> which is an older syntax, but one that has a sense when you read it.
Another limitation is that you are restricted to use only <code>pass</code> or <code>drop</code> commands for packets filtered by a bridge.
Sophisticated things like <code>divert</code>, <code>forward</code> or <code>reject</code> are not available.
Such options can still be used, but only on traffic to or from the bridge machine itself (if it has an IP address).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>New in FreeBSD 4.0, is the concept of stateful filtering.
This is a big improvement for UDP traffic, which typically is a request going out, followed shortly thereafter by a response with the same set of IP addresses and port numbers (but with source and destination reversed, of course).
For firewalls that have no statekeeping, there is almost no way to deal with this sort of traffic as a single session.
But with a firewall that can "remember" an outgoing UDP packet and, for the next few minutes, allow a response, handling UDP services is trivial.
The following example shows how to do it.
It is possible to do the same thing with TCP packets.
This allows you to avoid some denial of service attacks and other nasty tricks, but it also typically makes your state table grow quickly in size.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Let’s look at an example setup.
Note first that at the top of <span class=filename>/etc/rc.firewall</span> there are already standard rules for the loopback interface <span class=filename>lo0</span>, so we should not have to care for them anymore.
Custom rules should be put in a separate file (say <span class=filename>/etc/rc.firewall.local</span>) and loaded at system startup, by modifying the row of <span class=filename>/etc/rc.conf</span> where we defined the <code>open</code> firewall:</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre>firewall_type=&#34;/etc/rc.firewall.local&#34;</pre></div></div><div class="admonitionblock important"><table><tbody><tr><td class=icon><i class="fa icon-important" title=Important></i></td><td class=content><div class=paragraph><p>You have to specify the <em>full</em> path, otherwise it will not be loaded with the risk to remain isolated from the network.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=paragraph><p>For our example imagine to have the <span class=filename>fxp0</span> interface connected towards the outside (Internet) and the <span class=filename>xl0</span> towards the inside (LAN). The bridge machine has the IP <code>1.2.3.4</code> (it is not possible that your ISP can give you an address quite like this, but for our example it is good).</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre># Things that we have kept state on before get to go through in a hurry

In particular, there are no anti-spoofing rules, in fact we did <em>not</em> add:</p></div><div class="literalblock programlisting"><div class=content><pre>add deny all from 1.2.3.4/8 to any in via fxp0</pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>That is, drop packets that are coming in from the outside claiming to be from our network.
This is something that you would commonly do to be sure that someone does not try to evade the packet filter, by generating nefarious packets that look like they are from the inside.
The problem with that is that there is <em>at least</em> one host on the outside interface that you do not want to ignore: the router.
But usually, the ISP anti-spoofs at their router, so we do not need to bother that much.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The last rule seems to be an exact duplicate of the default rule, that is, do not let anything pass that is not specifically allowed.
But there is a difference: all suspected traffic will be logged.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>There are two rules for passing SMTP and DNS traffic towards the mail server and the name server, if you have them.
Obviously the whole rule set should be flavored to personal taste, this is only a specific example (rule format is described accurately in the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ipfw&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">ipfw(8)</a> man page).
Note that for "relay" and "ns" to work, name service lookups must work <em>before</em> the bridge is enabled.
This is an example of making sure that you set the IP on the correct network card.
Alternatively it is possible to specify the IP address instead of the host name (required if the machine is IP-less).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>People that are used to setting up firewalls are probably also used to either having a <code>reset</code> or a <code>forward</code> rule for ident packets (TCP port 113).
Unfortunately, this is not an applicable option with the bridge, so the best thing is to simply pass them to their destination.
As long as that destination machine is not running an ident daemon, this is relatively harmless.
The alternative is dropping connections on port 113, which creates some problems with services like IRC (the ident probe must timeout).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The only other thing that is a little weird that you may have noticed is that there is a rule to let the bridge machine speak, and another for internal hosts.
Remember that this is because the two sets of traffic will take different paths through the kernel and into the packet filter.
The inside net will go through the bridge, while the local machine will use the normal IP stack to speak.
Thus the two rules to handle the different cases.
The <code>in via fxp0</code> rules work for both paths.
In general, if you use <code>in via</code> rules throughout the filter, you will need to make an exception for locally generated packets, because they did not come in via any of our interfaces.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=filtering-bridges-contributors>6.
