That is great!
FreeBSD <em>relies</em> on the contributions of its user base to survive.
Your contributions are not only appreciated, they are vital to FreeBSD’s continued growth.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>A large and growing number of international contributors, of greatly varying ages and areas of technical expertise, develop FreeBSD.
There is always more work to be done than there are people available to do it, and more help is always appreciated.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>As a volunteer, what you do is limited only by what you want to do.
However, we do ask that you are aware of what other members of the FreeBSD community will expect of you.
You may want to take this into account before deciding to volunteer.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The FreeBSD project is responsible for an entire operating system environment, rather than just a kernel or a few scattered utilities.
As such, our <span class=filename>TODO</span> lists span a very wide range of tasks: from documentation, beta testing and presentation, to the system installer and highly specialized types of kernel development.
People of any skill level, in almost any area, can almost certainly help the project.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Commercial entities engaged in FreeBSD-related enterprises are also encouraged to contact us.
Do you need a special extension to make your product work?
You will find us receptive to your requests, given that they are not too outlandish.
Are you working on a value-added product?
Please let us know!
We may be able to work cooperatively on some aspect of it.
The free software world is challenging many existing assumptions about how software is developed, sold, and maintained, and we urge you to at least give it a second look.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=contrib-what>1. What Is Needed<a class=anchor href=#contrib-what></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>The following list of tasks and sub-projects represents something of an amalgam of various <span class=filename>TODO</span> lists and user requests.</p></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=non-programmer-tasks>1.1. Ongoing Non-Programmer Tasks<a class=anchor href=#non-programmer-tasks></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>Many people who are involved in FreeBSD are not programmers.
The Project includes documentation writers, Web designers, and support people.
All that these people need to contribute is an investment of time and a willingness to learn.</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><p>Read through the FAQ and Handbook periodically.
If anything is poorly explained, ambiguous, out of date or incorrect, let us know.
Even better, send us a fix (AsciiDoc is not difficult to learn, but there is no objection to plain text submissions).</p></li><li><p>Help translate FreeBSD documentation into your native language.
If documentation already exists for your language, you can help translate additional documents or verify that the translations are up-to-date and correct.
First take a look at the <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/fdp-primer/#translations>Translations FAQ</a> in the FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer.
You are not committing yourself to translating every single FreeBSD document by doing this - as a volunteer, you can do as much or as little translation as you desire.
Once someone begins translating, others almost always join the effort.
If you only have the time or energy to translate one part of the documentation, please translate the installation instructions.</p></li><li><p>Read the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-questions>FreeBSD general questions mailing list</a> occasionally (or even regularly).
It can be very satisfying to share your expertise and help people solve their problems; sometimes you may even learn something new yourself!
These forums can also be a source of ideas for things to improve upon.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=ongoing-programmer-tasks>1.2. Ongoing Programmer Tasks<a class=anchor href=#ongoing-programmer-tasks></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>Most of the tasks listed here may require a considerable investment of time, an in-depth knowledge of the FreeBSD kernel, or both.
However, there are also many useful tasks which are suitable for "weekend hackers".</p></div><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><p>If you run FreeBSD-CURRENT and have a good Internet connection, there is a machine <code>current.FreeBSD.org</code> which builds a full release once a day-every now and again, try to install the latest release from it and report any failures in the process.</p></li><li><p>Read the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-bugs>FreeBSD problem reports mailing list</a>.
There may be a problem you can comment constructively on or with patches you can test.
Or you could even try to fix one of the problems yourself.</p></li><li><p>If you know of any bug fixes which have been successfully applied to -CURRENT but have not been merged into -STABLE after a decent interval (normally a couple of weeks), send the committer a polite reminder.</p></li><li><p>Move contributed software to <span class=filename>src/contrib</span> in the source tree.</p></li><li><p>Make sure code in <span class=filename>src/contrib</span> is up to date.</p></li><li><p>Build the source tree (or just part of it) with extra warnings enabled and clean up the warnings.
A list of build warnings can also be found from our <a href=https://ci.freebsd.org>CI</a> by selecting a build and checking "LLVM/Clang Warnings".</p></li><li><p>Fix warnings for ports which do deprecated things like using <code>gets()</code> or including <span class=filename>malloc.h</span>.</p></li><li><p>If you have contributed any ports and you had to make FreeBSD-specific changes, send your patches back to the original authors (this will make your life easier when they bring out the next version).</p></li><li><p>Get copies of formal standards like POSIX®.
Compare FreeBSD’s behavior to that required by the standard.
If the behavior differs, particularly in subtle or obscure corners of the specification, send in a PR about it.
If you are able, figure out how to fix it and include a patch in the PR.
If you think the standard is wrong, ask the standards body to consider the question.</p></li><li><p>Suggest further tasks for this list!</p></li></ol></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_work_through_the_pr_database>1.3. Work through the PR Database<a class=anchor href=#_work_through_the_pr_database></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The <a href=https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/>FreeBSD PR list</a> shows all the current active problem reports and requests for enhancement that have been submitted by FreeBSD users.
The PR database includes both programmer and non-programmer tasks.
Look through the open PRs, and see if anything there takes your interest.
Some of these might be very simple tasks that just need an extra pair of eyes to look over them and confirm that the fix in the PR is a good one.
Others might be much more complex, or might not even have a fix included at all.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Start with the PRs that have not been assigned to anyone else.
If a PR is assigned to someone else, but it looks like something you can handle, email the person it is assigned to and ask if you can work on it-they might already have a patch ready to be tested, or further ideas that you can discuss with them.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_ongoing_ports_tasks>1.4. Ongoing Ports Tasks<a class=anchor href=#_ongoing_ports_tasks></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>The Ports Collection is a perpetual work in progress.
We want to provide our users with an easy to use, up to date, high quality repository of third party software.
We need people to donate some of their time and effort to help us achieve this goal.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Anyone can get involved, and there are lots of different ways to do so.
Contributing to ports is an excellent way to help "give back" something to the project.
Whether you are looking for an ongoing role, or a fun challenge for a rainy day, we would love to have your help!</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>There are a number of easy ways you can contribute to keeping the ports tree up to date and in good working order:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>Find some cool or useful software and <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/>create a port</a> for it.</p></li><li><p>There are a large number of ports that have no maintainer.
Become a maintainer and <a href=../contributing/#adopt-port>Adopting an unmaintained port</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you have created or adopted a port, be aware of <a href=../contributing/#maintain-port>The challenge for port maintainers</a>.</p></li><li><p>When you are looking for a quick challenge you could <a href=../contributing/#fix-broken>Finding and fixing a broken port</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_pick_one_of_the_items_from_the_ideas_page>1.5.

The list is being regularly updated and contains items for both programmers and non-programmers with information about each project.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=contrib-how>2. How to Contribute<a class=anchor href=#contrib-how></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Contributions to the system generally fall into one or more of the following 5 categories:</p></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=contrib-general>2.1. Bug Reports and General Commentary<a class=anchor href=#contrib-general></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>An idea or suggestion of <em>general</em> technical interest should be mailed to the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-hackers>FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list</a>.
Likewise, people with an interest in such things (and a tolerance for a <em>high</em> volume of mail!) may subscribe to the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-hackers>FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list</a>.
See <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/#eresources-mail>The FreeBSD Handbook</a> for more information about this and other mailing lists.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If you are submitting a simple patch to the src repo, please consider submitting it to the project’s GitHub mirror as <a href=https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/pulls>a pull request</a>.
Suitable submissions should:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>It is ready or nearly ready to be committed.
A committer should be able to land this patch with less than 10 minutes of additional work.</p></li><li><p>It passes all the GitHub CI jobs.</p></li><li><p>You can respond to feedback quickly.</p></li><li><p>It touches fewer than about 10 files and the changes are less than about 200 lines.
Changes larger than this may be OK, or you may be asked to submit multiple pull requests of a more manageable size.</p></li><li><p>Each logical change is a separate commit within the pull request.
Commit messages for each change should follow <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/committers-guide/#commit-log-message>commit log guide</a>.</p></li><li><p>All commits have your name and valid email address as you’d like to see them in the FreeBSD repository as the author.
Fake github.com addresses cannot be used.</p></li><li><p>The scope of the pull request should not change during review.
If the review suggests changes that expand the scope, please create an independent pull request.</p></li><li><p>Fixup commits should be squashed with the commit they are fixing.
Each commit in your branch should be suitable for FreeBSD’s repository.</p></li><li><p>Commits should include one or more <code>Signed-off-by:</code> lines with full name and email address certifying <a href=https://developercertificate.org/>Developer Certificate of Origin</a>.</p></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>When updating pull request, please rebase with a forced push rather than a merge commit.
More complex changes may be submitted as pull requests, but they may be closed if they are too large, too unwieldy, become inactive, need further discussion in the community, or need extensive revision.
Please avoid creating large, wide-ranging cleanup patches: they are too large and lack the focus needed for a good review.
Misdirected patches may be redirected to a more appropriate forum for the patch to be resolved.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Pull requests submitted to the ports repository may or may not see action, based on the whims of developers.
For now, you will have a better experience if you follow the ports submission
process <a href=../contributing/#ports-contributing>Contributing to ports</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The docs team also accepts pull requests via GitHub, but has not established any policy for them yet.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If you find a bug or are submitting a specific change, please report it using the <a href=https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/submit/>bug submission form</a>.
Try to fill-in each field of the bug report.
Unless they exceed 65KB, include any patches directly in the report.
If the patch is suitable to be applied to the source tree put <code>[PATCH]</code> in the synopsis of the report.
When including patches, <em>do not</em> use cut-and-paste because cut-and-paste turns tabs into spaces and makes them unusable.
When patches are a lot larger than 20KB, consider compressing them (for example with <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gzip&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">gzip(1)</a> or <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bzip2&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">bzip2(1)</a>) prior to uploading them.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>After filing a report, you should receive confirmation along with a tracking number.
Keep this tracking number so that you can update us with details about the problem.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>See also <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/problem-reports/>this article</a> on how to write good problem reports.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_changes_to_the_documentation>2.2.

Please look at the <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/fdp-primer/>FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer</a> for complete instructions.
Send submissions and changes (even small ones are welcome!) using the same method as any other bug report.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_changes_to_existing_source_code>2.3. Changes to Existing Source Code<a class=anchor href=#_changes_to_existing_source_code></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>An addition or change to the existing source code is a somewhat trickier affair and depends a lot on how far out of date you are with the current state of FreeBSD development.
There is a special on-going release of FreeBSD known as "FreeBSD-CURRENT" which is made available in a variety of ways for the convenience of developers working actively on the system.
See <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/#current-stable>The FreeBSD Handbook</a> for more information about getting and using FreeBSD-CURRENT.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Working from older sources unfortunately means that your changes may sometimes be too obsolete or too divergent for easy re-integration into FreeBSD.
Chances of this can be minimized somewhat by subscribing to the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-announce>FreeBSD announcements mailing list</a> and the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-current>FreeBSD-CURRENT mailing list</a> lists, where discussions on the current state of the system take place.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Assuming that you can manage to secure fairly up-to-date sources to base your changes on, the next step is to produce a set of diffs to send to the FreeBSD maintainers.
This is done with the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">diff(1)</a> command.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The preferred <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">diff(1)</a> format for submitting patches is the unified output format generated by <code>diff -u</code>.</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang=shell>% diff <span class=nt>-u</span> oldfile newfile</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>or</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang=shell>% diff <span class=nt>-u</span> <span class=nt>-r</span> <span class=nt>-N</span> olddir newdir</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>would generate a set of unified diffs for the given source file or directory hierarchy.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>See <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">diff(1)</a> for more information.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Once you have a set of diffs (which you may test with the <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=patch&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">patch(1)</a> command), you should submit them for inclusion with FreeBSD as a bug report.
<em>Do not</em> just send the diffs to the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-hackers>FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list</a> or they will get lost! We greatly appreciate your submission (this is a volunteer project!); because we are busy, we may not be able to address it immediately, but it will remain in the PR database until we do.
Indicate your submission by including <code>[PATCH]</code> in the synopsis of the report.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If you feel it appropriate (for example you have added, deleted, or renamed files), bundle your changes into a <code>tar</code> file.
Archives created with <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shar&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">shar(1)</a> are also welcome.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If your change is of a potentially sensitive nature, such as if you are unsure of copyright issues governing its further distribution then you should send it to <a href=mailto:core@FreeBSD.org>core@FreeBSD.org</a> directly rather than submitting as a bug report.
The <a href=mailto:core@FreeBSD.org>core@FreeBSD.org</a> reaches a much smaller group of people who do much of the day-to-day work on FreeBSD.
Note that this group is also <em>very busy</em> and so you should only send mail to them where it is truly necessary.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Please refer to <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=intro&amp;sektion=9&amp;format=html">intro(9)</a> and <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&amp;sektion=9&amp;format=html">style(9)</a> for some information on coding style.
We would appreciate it if you were at least aware of this information before submitting code.</p></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=_new_code_or_major_value_added_packages>2.4. New Code or Major Value-Added Packages<a class=anchor href=#_new_code_or_major_value_added_packages></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>In the case of a significant contribution of a large body work, or the addition of an important new feature to FreeBSD, it becomes almost always necessary to either send changes as tar files or upload them to a web or FTP site for other people to access.
If you do not have access to a web or FTP site, ask on an appropriate FreeBSD mailing list for someone to host the changes for you.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When working with large amounts of code, the touchy subject of copyrights also invariably comes up.
FreeBSD prefers free software licenses such as BSD or ISC.
Copyleft licenses such as GPLv2 are sometimes permitted.

Choosing an unmaintained port<a class=anchor href=#_choosing_an_unmaintained_port></a></h4><div class=paragraph><p>Taking over maintainership of ports that are unmaintained is a great way to get involved.
Unmaintained ports are only updated and fixed when somebody volunteers to work on them.
There are a large number of unmaintained ports.
It is a good idea to start with adopting a port that you use regularly.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Unmaintained ports have their <code>MAINTAINER</code> set to <code>ports@FreeBSD.org</code>.
Many unmaintained ports can have pending updates, this can be seen at the <a href=https://portscout.freebsd.org/ports@freebsd.org.html>FreeBSD Ports distfile scanner</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>On <a href="https://portsfallout.com/fallout?port=&amp;maintainer=ports%40FreeBSD.org">PortsFallout</a> can be seen a list of unmaintained ports with errors.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Some ports affect a large number of others due to dependencies and secondary port relationships.
Generally, we want people to have some experience before they maintain such ports.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>You can find out whether or not a port has dependencies or secondary ports by looking at a primary index of ports called <span class=filename>INDEX</span>.
(The name of the file varies by release of FreeBSD; for instance, <span class=filename>INDEX-13</span>.) Some ports have conditional dependencies that are not included in a default <span class=filename>INDEX</span> build.
We expect you to be able to recognize such ports by looking through other ports' <span class=filename>Makefile</span>'s.</p></div></div><div class=sect3><h4 id=_how_to_adopt_the_port>3.1.2. How to adopt the port<a class=anchor href=#_how_to_adopt_the_port></a></h4><div class=paragraph><p>First make sure you understand your <a href=../contributing/#maintain-port>The challenge for port maintainers</a>.
Also read the <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/>Porter’s Handbook</a>.
<em>Please do not commit yourself to more than you feel you can comfortably handle.</em></p></div><div class=paragraph><p>You may request maintainership of any unmaintained port as soon as you wish.
Simply set <code>MAINTAINER</code> to your own email address and send a PR (Problem Report) with the change.
If the port has build errors or needs updating, you may wish to include any other changes in the same PR.
This will help because many committers are less willing to assign maintainership to someone who does not have a known track record with FreeBSD.
Submitting PRs that fix build errors or update ports are the best ways to establish one.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>File your PR with Product <code>Ports & Packages</code>.
A committer will examine your PR, commit the changes, and finally close the PR.
Sometimes this process can take a little while (committers are volunteers, too :).</p></div></div></div><div class=sect2><h3 id=maintain-port>3.2. The challenge for port maintainers<a class=anchor href=#maintain-port></a></h3><div class=paragraph><p>This section will give you an idea of why ports need to be maintained and outline the responsibilities of a port maintainer.</p></div><div class=sect3><h4 id=why-maintenance>3.2.1. Why ports require maintenance<a class=anchor href=#why-maintenance></a></h4><div class=paragraph><p>Creating a port is a once-off task.
Ensuring that a port is up to date and continues to build and run requires an ongoing maintenance effort.
Maintainers are the people who dedicate some of their time to meeting these goals.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>The foremost reason ports need maintenance is to bring the latest and greatest in third party software to the FreeBSD community.
An additional challenge is to keep individual ports working within the Ports Collection framework as it evolves.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>As a maintainer, you will need to manage the following challenges:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p><strong>New software versions and updates.</strong> New versions and updates of existing ported software become available all the time, and these need to be incorporated into the Ports Collection to provide up-to-date software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changes to dependencies.</strong> If significant changes are made to the dependencies of your port, it may need to be updated so that it will continue to work correctly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changes affecting dependent ports.</strong> If other ports depend on a port that you maintain, changes to your port may require coordination with other maintainers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interaction with other users, maintainers and developers.</strong> Part of being a maintainer is taking on a support role.
You are not expected to provide general support (but we welcome it if you choose to do so). What you should provide is a point of coordination for FreeBSD-specific issues regarding your ports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bug hunting.</strong> A port may be affected by bugs which are specific to FreeBSD.
You will need to investigate, find, and fix these bugs when they are reported.
Thoroughly testing a port to identify problems before they make their way into the Ports Collection is even better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changes to ports infrastructure and policy.</strong> Occasionally the systems that are used to build ports and packages are updated or a new recommendation affecting the infrastructure is made.
You should be aware of these changes in case your ports are affected and require updating.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changes to the base system.</strong> FreeBSD is under constant development.
Changes to software, libraries, the kernel or even policy changes can cause flow-on change requirements to ports.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class=sect3><h4 id=_maintainer_responsibilities>3.2.2.

It is common for a port to work on one branch or platform and fail on another.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your port’s dependencies are complete.
The recommended way of doing this is by installing your own ports tinderbox.
See <a href=../contributing/#resources>Resources for ports maintainers and contributors</a> for more information.</p></li><li><p>Check that the packing list is up to date.
This involves adding in any new files and directories and removing unused entries.</p></li><li><p>Verify your port using <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=portlint&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">portlint(1)</a> as a guide.
See <a href=../contributing/#resources>Resources for ports maintainers and contributors</a> for important information about using portlint.</p></li><li><p>Consider whether changes to your port might cause any other ports to break.
If this is the case, coordinate the changes with the maintainers of those ports.
This is especially important if your update changes the shared library version; in this case, at the very least, the dependent ports will need to get a <code>PORTREVISION</code> bump so that they will automatically be upgraded by automated tools such as <a class=package href=https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/ports-mgmt/poudriere/>ports-mgmt/poudriere</a>.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Submit changes</p><div class=paragraph><p>Send your update by submitting a PR with an explanation of the changes and a patch containing the differences between the original port and the updated one.
