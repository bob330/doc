&lt;p>Log in (when you see &lt;code>login:&lt;/code>) as a user you created during installation or as &lt;code>root&lt;/code>.
(Your FreeBSD installation will already have an account for &lt;code>root&lt;/code>;
who can go anywhere and do anything, including deleting essential files, so be careful!)
The symbols % and # in the following stand for the prompt (yours may be different), with % indicating an ordinary user and # indicating &lt;code>root&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The 4.4BSD kernel provides four basic facilities: processes, a filesystem, communications, and system startup.
This section outlines where each of these four basic services is described in this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="olist arabic">
&lt;ol class="arabic">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Processes constitute a thread of control in an address space. Mechanisms for creating, terminating, and otherwise controlling processes are described in Chapter 4. The system multiplexes separate virtual-address spaces for each process; this memory management is discussed in Chapter 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The user interface to the filesystem and devices is similar; common aspects are discussed in Chapter 6. The filesystem is a set of named files, organized in a tree-structured hierarchy of directories, and of operations to manipulate them, as presented in Chapter 7. Files reside on physical media such as disks. 4.4BSD supports several organizations of data on the disk, as set forth in Chapter 8. Access to files on remote machines is the subject of Chapter 9. Terminals are used to access the system; their operation is the subject of Chapter 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Communication mechanisms provided by traditional UNIX systems include simplex reliable byte streams between related processes (see pipes, Section 11.1), and notification of exceptional events (see signals, Section 4.7). 4.4BSD also has a general interprocess-communication facility. This facility, described in Chapter 11, uses access mechanisms distinct from those of the filesystem, but, once a connection is set up, a process can access it as though it were a pipe. There is a general networking framework, discussed in Chapter 12, that is normally used as a layer underlying the IPC facility. Chapter 13 describes a particular networking implementation in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Any real operating system has operational issues, such as how to start it running. Startup and operational issues are described in Chapter 14.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
