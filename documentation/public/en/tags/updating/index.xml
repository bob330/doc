&lt;p>The FreeBSD Ports Collection is constantly changing.
Here is some information on how to keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been committed is by subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts&lt;/a>.
Multiple ports can be monitored.
Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made.
(These are often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports framework-although it would be most polite to receive an advance heads-up from those committing such changes, sometimes this is overlooked or impractical.
Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor in nature.
We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these cases.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since system administration is a difficult task, many tools have been developed to make life easier for the administrator.
These tools often enhance the way systems are installed, configured, and maintained.
One of the tools which can be used to enhance the security of a FreeBSD system is &lt;em>jails&lt;/em>.
Jails have been available since FreeBSD 4.X and continue to be enhanced in their usefulness, performance, reliability, and security.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>FreeBSD is under constant development between releases.
Some people prefer to use the officially released versions, while others prefer to keep in sync with the latest developments.
However, even official releases are often updated with security and other critical fixes.
Regardless of the version used, FreeBSD provides all the necessary tools to keep the system updated, and allows for easy upgrades between versions.
This chapter describes how to track the development system and the basic tools for keeping a FreeBSD system up-to-date.&lt;/p>
