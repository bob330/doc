&lt;p>Abstract&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Often it is useful to divide one physical network (like an Ethernet) into two separate segments without having to create subnets, and use a router to link them together.
The device that connects the two networks in this way is called a bridge.
A FreeBSD system with two network interfaces is enough to act as a bridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>A bridge works by scanning the addresses of MAC level (Ethernet addresses) of the devices connected to each of its network interfaces and then forwarding the traffic between the two networks only if the source and the destination are on different segments.
Under many points of view a bridge is similar to an Ethernet switch with only two ports.&lt;/p>
