Introduction<a class=anchor href=#pr-intro></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>One of the most frustrating experiences one can have as a software user is to submit a problem report only to have it summarily closed with a terse and unhelpful explanation like "not a bug" or "bogus PR". Similarly, one of the most frustrating experiences as a software developer is to be flooded with problem reports that are not really problem reports but requests for support, or that contain little or no information about what the problem is and how to reproduce it.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>This document attempts to describe how to write good problem reports. What, you ask, is a good problem report? Well, to go straight to the bottom line, a good problem report is one that can be analyzed and dealt with swiftly, to the mutual satisfaction of both user and developer.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Although the primary focus of this article is on FreeBSD problem reports, most of it should apply quite well to other software projects.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Note that this article is organized thematically, not chronologically, so you should read through the entire document before submitting a problem report, rather than treat it as a step-by-step tutorial.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=pr-when>2. When to submit a problem report<a class=anchor href=#pr-when></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>There are many types of problems, and not all of them should engender a problem report. Of course, nobody is perfect, and there will be times when you are convinced you have found a bug in a program when in fact you have misunderstood the syntax for a command or made a typographical error in a configuration file (though that in itself may sometimes be indicative of poor documentation or poor error handling in the application). There are still many cases where submitting a problem report is clearly <em>not</em> the right course of action, and will only serve to frustrate you and the developers. Conversely, there are cases where it might be appropriate to submit a problem report about something else than a bug-an enhancement or a feature request, for instance.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>So how do you determine what is a bug and what is not? As a simple rule of thumb your problem is <em>not</em> a bug if it can be expressed as a question (usually of the form "How do I do X?" or "Where can I find Y?"). It is not always quite so black and white, but the question rule covers a large majority of cases. If you are looking for an answer, consider posing your question to the <a href=https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-questions>FreeBSD general questions 郵遞論壇</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Some cases where it may be appropriate to submit a problem report about something that is not a bug are:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>Requests for feature enhancements. It is generally a good idea to air these on the mailing lists before submitting a problem report.</p></li><li><p>Notification of updates to externally maintained software (mainly ports, but also externally maintained base system components such as BIND or various GNU utilities).</p><div class=paragraph><p>For unmaintained ports (<code>MAINTAINER</code> contains <code>ports@FreeBSD.org</code>), such update notifications might get picked up by an interested committer, or you might be asked to provide a patch to update the port; providing it upfront will greatly improve your chances that the port will get updated in a timely manner.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If the port is maintained, PRs announcing new upstream releases are usually not very useful since they generate supplementary work for the committers, and the maintainer likely knows already there is a new version, they have probably worked with the developers on it, they are probably testing to see there is no regression, etc.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>In either case, following the process described in <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/#port-upgrading>Porter’s Handbook</a> will yield the best results.</p></div></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>A bug that can not be reproduced can rarely be fixed. If the bug only occurred once and you can not reproduce it, and it does not seem to happen to anybody else, chances are none of the developers will be able to reproduce it or figure out what is wrong. That does not mean it did not happen, but it does mean that the chances of your problem report ever leading to a bug fix are very slim. To make matters worse, often these kinds of bugs are actually caused by failing hard drives or overheating processors - you should always try to rule out these causes, whenever possible, before submitting a PR.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Next, to decide to whom you should file your problem report, you need to understand that the software that makes up FreeBSD is composed of several different elements:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained by FreeBSD contributors, such as the kernel, the C library, and the device drivers (categorized as <code>kern</code>); the binary utilities (<code>bin</code>); the manual pages and documentation (<code>docs</code>); and the web pages (<code>www</code>). All bugs in these areas should be reported to the FreeBSD developers.</p></li><li><p>Code in the base system that is written and maintained by others, and imported into FreeBSD and adapted. Examples include bind, <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gcc&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">gcc(1)</a>, and <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">sendmail(8)</a>. Most bugs in these areas should be reported to the FreeBSD developers; but in some cases they may need to be reported to the original authors instead if the problems are not FreeBSD-specific. Usually these bugs will fall under either the <code>bin</code> or <code>gnu</code> categories.</p></li><li><p>Individual applications that are not in the base system but are instead part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection (category <code>ports</code>). Most of these applications are not written by FreeBSD developers; what FreeBSD provides is merely a framework for installing the application. Therefore, you should only report a problem to the FreeBSD developers when you believe the problem is FreeBSD-specific; otherwise, you should report it to the authors of the software.</p></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>Then you should ascertain whether or not the problem is timely. There are few things that will annoy a developer more than receiving a problem report about a bug she has already fixed.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If the problem is in the base system, you should first read the FAQ section on <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#LATEST-VERSION>FreeBSD versions</a>, if you are not already familiar with the topic. It is not possible for FreeBSD to fix problems in anything other than certain recent branches of the base system, so filing a bug report about an older version will probably only result in a developer advising you to upgrade to a supported version to see if the problem still recurs. The Security Officer team maintains the <a href=http://www.freebsd.org/security/>list of supported versions</a>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If the problem is in a port, note that you must first upgrade to the latest version of the Ports Collection and see if the problem still applies. Due to the rapid pace of changes in these applications, it is infeasible for FreeBSD to support anything other than the absolute latest versions, and problems with older version of applications simply cannot be fixed.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=pr-prep>3. Preparations<a class=anchor href=#pr-prep></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>A good rule to follow is to always do a background search before submitting a problem report. Maybe your problem has already been reported; maybe it is being discussed on the mailing lists, or recently was; it may even already be fixed in a newer version than what you are running. You should therefore check all the obvious places before submitting your problem report. For FreeBSD, this means:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>The FreeBSD <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/>Frequently Asked Questions</a> (FAQ) list. The FAQ attempts to provide answers for a wide range of questions, such as those concerning <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#hardware>hardware compatibility</a>, <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#applications>user applications</a>, and <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#kernelconfig>kernel configuration</a>.</p></li><li><p>The <a href=https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/#eresources-mail>mailing lists</a>-if you are not subscribed, use <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/#mailinglists>the searchable archives</a> on the FreeBSD web site. If your problem has not been discussed on the lists, you might try posting a message about it and waiting a few days to see if someone can spot something you have overlooked.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, the entire web-use your favorite search engine to locate any references to your problem. You may even get hits from archived mailing lists or newsgroups you did not know of or had not thought to search through.</p></li><li><p>Next, the searchable <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query>FreeBSD PR database</a> (GNATS). Unless your problem is recent or obscure, there is a fair chance it has already been reported.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly, you should attempt to see if existing documentation in the source base addresses your problem.</p><div class=paragraph><p>For the base FreeBSD code, you should carefully study the contents of the <span class=filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</span> file on your system or its latest version at <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/UPDATING>http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/UPDATING</a>. (This is vital information if you are upgrading from one version to another-especially if you are upgrading to the FreeBSD-CURRENT branch).</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>However, if the problem is in something that was installed as a part of the FreeBSD Ports Collection, you should refer to <span class=filename>/usr/ports/UPDATING</span> (for individual ports) or <span class=filename>/usr/ports/CHANGES</span> (for changes that affect the entire Ports Collection). <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/UPDATING>http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/UPDATING</a> and <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/CHANGES>http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/CHANGES</a> are also available via CVSweb.</p></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=pr-writing>4. Writing the problem report<a class=anchor href=#pr-writing></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>Now that you have decided that your issue merits a problem report, and that it is a FreeBSD problem, it is time to write the actual problem report. Before we get into the mechanics of the program used to generate and submit PRs, here are some tips and tricks to help make sure that your PR will be most effective.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_tips_and_tricks_for_writing_a_good_problem_report>5. Tips and tricks for writing a good problem report<a class=anchor href=#_tips_and_tricks_for_writing_a_good_problem_report></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=ulist><ul><li><p><em>Do not leave the "Synopsis" line empty.</em> The PRs go both onto a mailing list that goes all over the world (where the "Synopsis" is used for the <code>Subject:</code> line), but also into a database. Anyone who comes along later and browses the database by synopsis, and finds a PR with a blank subject line, tends just to skip over it. Remember that PRs stay in this database until they are closed by someone; an anonymous one will usually just disappear in the noise.</p></li><li><p><em>Avoid using a weak "Synopsis" line.</em> You should not assume that anyone reading your PR has any context for your submission, so the more you provide, the better. For instance, what part of the system does the problem apply to? Do you only see the problem while installing, or while running? To illustrate, instead of <code>Synopsis: portupgrade is broken</code>, see how much more informative this seems: <code>Synopsis: port sysutils/portupgrade coredumps on -current</code>. (In the case of ports, it is especially helpful to have both the category and portname in the "Synopsis" line.)</p></li><li><p><em>If you have a patch, say so.</em> A PR with a patch included is much more likely to be looked at than one without. If you are including one, put the string <code>[patch]</code> at the beginning of the "Synopsis". (Although it is not mandatory to use that exact string, by convention, that is the one that is used.)</p></li><li><p><em>If you are a maintainer, say so.</em> If you are maintaining a part of the source code (for instance, a port), you might consider adding the string <code>[maintainer update]</code> at the beginning of your synopsis line, and you definitely should set the "Class" of your PR to <code>maintainer-update</code>. This way any committer that handles your PR will not have to check.</p></li><li><p><em>Be specific.</em> The more information you supply about what problem you are having, the better your chance of getting a response.</p><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>Include the version of FreeBSD you are running (there is a place to put that, see below) and on which architecture. You should include whether you are running from a release (e.g. from a CDROM or download), or from a system maintained by <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cvsup&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">cvsup(1)</a> (and, if so, how recently you updated). If you are tracking the FreeBSD-CURRENT branch, that is the very first thing someone will ask, because fixes (especially for high-profile problems) tend to get committed very quickly, and FreeBSD-CURRENT users are expected to keep up.</p></li><li><p>Include which global options you have specified in your <span class=filename>make.conf</span>. Note: specifying <code>-O2</code> and above to <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gcc&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">gcc(1)</a> is known to be buggy in many situations. While the FreeBSD developers will accept patches, they are generally unwilling to investigate such issues due to simple lack of time and volunteers, and may instead respond that this just is not supported.</p></li><li><p>If this is a kernel problem, then be prepared to supply the following information. (You do not have to include these by default, which only tends to fill up the database, but you should include excerpts that you think might be relevant):</p><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>your kernel configuration (including which hardware devices you have installed)</p></li><li><p>whether or not you have debugging options enabled (such as <code>WITNESS</code>), and if so, whether the problem persists when you change the sense of that option</p></li><li><p>a backtrace, if one was generated</p></li><li><p>the fact that you have read <span class=filename>src/UPDATING</span> and that your problem is not listed there (someone is guaranteed to ask)</p></li><li><p>whether or not you can run any other kernel as a fallback (this is to rule out hardware-related issues such as failing disks and overheating CPUs, which can masquerade as kernel problems)</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>If this is a ports problem, then be prepared to supply the following information. (You do not have to include these by default, which only tends to fill up the database, but you should include excerpts that you think might be relevant):</p><div class=ulist><ul><li><p>which ports you have installed</p></li><li><p>any environment variables that override the defaults in <span class=filename>bsd.port.mk</span>, such as <code>PORTSDIR</code></p></li><li><p>the fact that you have read <span class=filename>ports/UPDATING</span> and that your problem is not listed there (someone is guaranteed to ask)</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li><p><em>Avoid vague requests for features.</em> PRs of the form "someone should really implement something that does so-and-so" are less likely to get results than very specific requests. Remember, the source is available to everyone, so if you want a feature, the best way to ensure it being included is to get to work! Also consider the fact that many things like this would make a better topic for discussion on <code>freebsd-questions</code> than an entry in the PR database, as discussed above.</p></li><li><p><em>Make sure no one else has already submitted a similar PR.</em> Although this has already been mentioned above, it bears repeating here. It only take a minute or two to use the web-based search engine at <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query>http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?query</a>. (Of course, everyone is guilty of forgetting to do this now and then.)</p></li><li><p><em>Avoid controversial requests.</em> If your PR addresses an area that has been controversial in the past, you should probably be prepared to not only offer patches, but also justification for why the patches are "The Right Thing To Do". As noted above, a careful search of the mailing lists using the archives at <a href=http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/#mailinglists>http://www.FreeBSD.org/search/#mailinglists</a> is always good preparation.</p></li><li><p><em>Be polite.</em> Almost anyone who would potentially work on your PR is a volunteer. No one likes to be told that they have to do something when they are already doing it for some motivation other than monetary gain. This is a good thing to keep in mind at all times on Open Source projects.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_before_you_begin>6.

If you cannot post mail messages from the machine you are running <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">send-pr(1)</a> on, your problem report will not reach the GNATS database.

In particular, if your mailer automatically breaks lines, changes tabs to spaces, or escapes newline characters, any patch that you submit will be rendered unusable. For the text sections, however, we request that you insert manual linebreaks somewhere around 70 characters, so that the web display of the PR will be readable.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Similar considerations apply if you are using the web-based PR submittal form instead of <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">send-pr(1)</a>. Note that cut-and-paste operations can have their own side-effects on text formatting.

Just use the <code>-a</code> command-line option to specify the names of the files you wish to attach:</p></div><div class=listingblock><div class=content><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang=shell>% send-pr <span class=nt>-a</span> /var/run/dmesg <span class=nt>-a</span> /tmp/errors</code></pre></div></div><div class=paragraph><p>Do not worry about binary files, they will be automatically encoded so as not to upset your mail agent.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If you attach a patch, make sure you use the <code>-c</code> or <code>-u</code> option to <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">diff(1)</a> to create a context or unified diff (unified is preferred), and make sure to specify the exact CVS revision numbers of the files you modified so the developers who read your report will be able to apply them easily. For problems with the kernel or the base utilities, a patch against FreeBSD-CURRENT (the HEAD CVS branch) is preferred since all new code should be applied and tested there first. After appropriate or substantial testing has been done, the code will be merged/migrated to the FreeBSD-STABLE branch.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>If you attach a patch inline, instead of as an attachment, note that the most common problem by far is the tendency of some email programs to render tabs as spaces, which will completely ruin anything intended to be part of a Makefile.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Do not send patches as attachments using <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</code>. These will perform character escaping and the entire patch will be useless.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>Also note that while including small patches in a PR is generally all right-particularly when they fix the problem described in the PR-large patches and especially new code which may require substantial review before committing should be placed on a web or ftp server, and the URL should be included in the PR instead of the patch. Patches in email tend to get mangled, especially when GNATS is involved, and the larger the patch, the harder it will be for interested parties to unmangle it. Also, posting a patch on the web allows you to modify it without having to resubmit the entire patch in a followup to the original PR. Finally, large patches simply increase the size of the database, since closed PRs are not actually deleted but instead kept and simply marked as <code>closed</code>.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>You should also take note that unless you explicitly specify otherwise in your PR or in the patch itself, any patches you submit will be assumed to be licensed under the same terms as the original file you modified.</p></div></div></div><div class=sect1><h2 id=_filling_out_the_template>8. Filling out the template<a class=anchor href=#_filling_out_the_template></a></h2><div class=sectionbody><div class=paragraph><p>The next section applies to the email method only:</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>When you run <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=send-pr&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">send-pr(1)</a>, you are presented with a template. The template consists of a list of fields, some of which are pre-filled, and some of which have comments explaining their purpose or listing acceptable values. Do not worry about the comments; they will be removed automatically if you do not modify them or remove them yourself.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>At the top of the template, below the <code>SEND-PR:</code> lines, are the email headers. You do not normally need to modify these, unless you are sending the problem report from a machine or account that can send but not receive mail, in which case you will want to set the <code>From:</code> and <code>Reply-To:</code> to your real email address. You may also want to send yourself (or someone else) a carbon copy of the problem report by adding one or more email addresses to the <code>Cc:</code> header.</p></div><div class=paragraph><p>In the email template you will find the following two single-line fields:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p><em>Submitter-Id:</em> Do not change this. The default value of <code>current-users</code> is correct, even if you run FreeBSD-STABLE.</p></li><li><p><em>Confidential:</em> This is prefilled to <code>no</code>. Changing it makes no sense as there is no such thing as a confidential FreeBSD problem report-the PR database is distributed worldwide by CVSup.</p></li></ul></div><div class=paragraph><p>The next section describes fields that are common to both the email interface and the web interface:</p></div><div class=ulist><ul><li><p><em>Originator:</em> Please specify your real name, optionally followed by your email address in angle brackets. In the email interface, this is normally prefilled with the <code>gecos</code> field of the currently logged-in user.</p><div class="admonitionblock note"><table><tbody><tr><td class=icon><i class="fa icon-note" title=Note></i></td><td class=content><div class=paragraph><p>The email address you use will become public information and may become available to spammers. You should either have spam handling procedures in place, or use a temporary email account. However, please note that if you do not use a valid email account at all, we will not be able to ask you questions about your PR.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li><p><em>Organization:</em> Whatever you feel like. This field is not used for anything significant.</p></li><li><p><em>Synopsis:</em> Fill this out with a short and accurate description of the problem. The synopsis is used as the subject of the problem report email, and is used in problem report listings and summaries; problem reports with obscure synopses tend to get ignored.</p><div class=paragraph><p>As noted above, if your problem report includes a patch, please have the synopsis start with <code>[patch]</code>; if this is a ports PR and you are the maintainer, you may consider adding <code>[maintainer update]</code> and set the "Class" of your PR to <code>maintainer-update</code>.</p></div></li><li><p><em>Severity:</em> One of <code>non-critical</code>, <code>serious</code> or <code>critical</code>. Do not overreact; refrain from labeling your problem <code>critical</code> unless it really is (e.g. data corruption issues, serious regression from previous functionality in -CURRENT) or <code>serious</code> unless it is something that will affect many users (kernel panics or freezes; problems with particular device drivers or system utilities). FreeBSD developers will not necessarily work on your problem faster if you inflate its importance since there are so many other people who have done exactly that - in fact, some developers pay little attention to this field because of this.</p><div class="admonitionblock note"><table><tbody><tr><td class=icon><i class="fa icon-note" title=Note></i></td><td class=content><div class=paragraph><p>Major security problems should <em>not</em> be filed in GNATS, because all GNATS information is public knowledge.
