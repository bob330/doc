&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Flavors are a way to have multiple variations of a port.
The port is built multiple times, with variations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>For example, a port can have a normal version with many features and quite a few dependencies, and a light &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; version with only basic features and minimal dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Another example could be, a port can have a GTK flavor and a QT flavor, depending on which toolkit it uses.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="sectionbody">
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software.
Arguably, the most dangerous of them are those opening security vulnerabilities.
From the technical viewpoint, such vulnerabilities are to be closed by exterminating the bugs that caused them.
However, the policies for handling mere bugs and security vulnerabilities are very different.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>A typical small bug affects only those users who have enabled some combination of options triggering the bug.
The developer will eventually release a patch followed by a new version of the software,
free of the bug, but the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading immediately because the bug has never vexed them.
A critical bug that may cause data loss represents a graver issue.
Nevertheless, prudent users know that a lot of possible accidents, besides software bugs, are likely to lead to data loss, and so they make backups of important data; in addition, a critical bug will be discovered really soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Here is a list of common dos and donâ€™ts that are encountered during the porting process.
Check the port against this list, but also check ports in the &lt;a href="https://bugs.FreeBSD.org/search/">PR database&lt;/a> that others have submitted.
Submit any comments on ports as described in &lt;a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/zh-tw/articles/contributing/#CONTRIB-GENERAL">Bug Reports and General Commentary&lt;/a>.
Checking ports in the PR database will both make it faster for us to commit them, and prove that you know what you are doing.&lt;/p>

Keeping Up</title><link>http://172.16.201.134:1313/zh-tw/books/porters-handbook/keeping-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://172.16.201.134:1313/zh-tw/books/porters-handbook/keeping-up/</guid><description>&lt;div id="preamble">

&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The FreeBSD Ports Collection is constantly changing.
Here is some information on how to keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="sect1">
&lt;h2 id="freshports">16.1. FreshPorts&lt;a class="anchor" href="#freshports">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="sectionbody">
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been committed is by subscribing to &lt;a href="http://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts&lt;/a>.
Multiple ports can be monitored.
Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made.
(These are often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports framework-although it would be most polite to receive an advance heads-up from those committing such changes, sometimes this is overlooked or impractical.
Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor in nature.
We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these cases.)&lt;/p>
