&lt;p>The FreeBSD Ports Collection is constantly changing.
Here is some information on how to keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been committed is by subscribing to &lt;a href="http://www.FreshPorts.org/">FreshPorts&lt;/a>.
Multiple ports can be monitored.
Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because they will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made.
(These are often necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports framework-although it would be most polite to receive an advance heads-up from those committing such changes, sometimes this is overlooked or impractical.
Also, in some cases, the changes are very minor in nature.
We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these cases.)&lt;/p>
